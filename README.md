# pytearcat-wormhole-metric
Symbolic computation of the Christoffel symbols, Ricci tensor, Ricci scalar, and Einstein tensor for a spherically symmetric wormhole spacetime using the PyTearcat library. This project demonstrates how to define custom metrics, compute curvature quantities, and explore general relativistic geometry through symbolic tensor algebra.
